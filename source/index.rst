ESP32-S3 Arduino Uno Project
==================================

*This guide will walk you through the steps required to design an ESP32-S3 development board.
The schematic design for this development board is based on the technical guidelines
for ESP32-S3 WROOM module.*

*ESP32-S3 WROOM is a widely used microcontroller module. It is compact and packs significant
computing power and capabilities. The image below showcases the 3D model of completed ESP32-S3
Uno development board.*
